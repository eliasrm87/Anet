# Anet A8

Find here all sources I'm using for improving my Anet A8 3D printer and some other Anets.

Most of the files are not mine, you can check file headers for author references, I'll also try to refer all sources at the end of this file.

**You are free to use/follow all this files and documentation at your own risk.**

# Anet A6 (Not working yet)

I only have an Anet A8, so everything I share here for that printer has been tested by my self on my own printer, I can not say the same for the A6, so be very careful when using what I have here on this printer.
